        title: 'What is RHEMA?',
        description: `
            THE WORD "RHEMA" is infused in everything connected with Kenneth Hagin Ministries. But what is it exactly? The following three answers will shed light on the meaning of "RHEMA," revealing the origin of something very powerful.

            RHEMA—A Spoken Word
            The Greek word rhḗma simply means "any spoken word." In the New Testament, there are two different Greek words used to identify words from God: lógos and rhḗma.

            Logos is used in John 1:1 (NKJV). "In the beginning was the [logos] Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1 NKJV).

            RHEMA is a spoken word. "And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the [spoken] word of God" (Eph. 6:17 NKJV).

            When Jesus was tempted by Satan in the wilderness, He countered each temptation by speaking a "RHEMA" word. In Matthew 4:4, He said, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every [spoken (RHEMA)] word.' " Jesus spoke the written Word He needed for the situation. So a RHEMA word can be the spoken Word of God.

            We need the written Word as our foundation, but we also need the spoken Word (RHEMA) for direction. We have the written Word, to stand on. We have RHEMA, the spoken Word, so we know what to do and where to go.

            When the Holy Spirit speaks to you, He quickens a Scripture verse or specific direction to you—a specific word for a specific time and purpose.


            RHEMA—A Place
            RHEMA Bible Training Center/College began with a quickened word spoken by my dad, Kenneth E. Hagin. When Dad received the mandate, "Go teach My people faith," that was a RHEMA word to him of what to do in ministry. I often heard him pray, "Lord, how am I going to get this message out? I'm just one man."

            His answer came during Campmeeting 1973. Dad said under the inspiration of the Spirit, "We're going to start a Bible school!" When he said that, I had a RHEMA word inside of me—Lynette and I were to help Dad start the school. Those RHEMA words gave the direction of how to get the faith message out and fulfill the mandate.

            Dad didn't want to put his name on the school. When we discussed what to call it, he suggested "RHEMA" based on a message Roy Hicks taught at Campmeeting.

            We chose the name RHEMA Bible Training Center/College because it is purpose driven, not personality driven. And it's still not personality driven! It was founded on the principles of the infallible Word of God, learning how to be led by the Spirit, and knowing the authority of the believer—while zeroing in on the practical aspects of ministry.

            RHEMA—A Worldwide Family
            Back in the 1930s, a young farmer got saved at a tent meeting. His parents didn't like it, so they wouldn't let him go back to the tent meeting. But he would come up to a grassy knoll on the family farm—right about where RHEMA Bible Church stands today—to read his Bible and pray. He had a vision that a mighty work of God would be raised up on that very place. The Lord told him that from this place, the Gospel would go out all over the world.

            The young man had a RHEMA word—a word from God! This campus was God ordained. It wasn't man's idea. It was God's idea. And from this place, men and women have been trained with the message of faith and have gone around the world.

            It's like throwing a rock in a pond. There's a splash and it ripples across the water. People have gone out from RHEMA and started churches. Men and women are coming from those churches to be trained. Then they're going back out to start what God spoke to them.

            For many years there was only one RHEMA. But today there are over 250 RHEMA Bible Training Center/College campuses in over 50 nations. It has become a worldwide family!

            You might say, "I didn't graduate from RHEMA." If you follow this ministry, have sown seed into it, or have learned and grown from the books and teachings, then you are part of the family. It's all of us together. We are the RHEMA family.

            We have been raised up to fulfill the Great Commission. Thank God for RHEMA!

            RHEMA is the spoken Word. RHEMA is a place to be trained. RHEMA is a worldwide family. And together we have one mandate—"Go teach My people faith."

            Rhḗma—A Definition
            rhḗma (ῥῆμα in Greek); that which is spoken, what is uttered in speech or writing; 1 an utterance (individually, collectively, or specifically); 2 the word by which something is commanded, directed, or enjoined; 3 something that is spoken clearly and vividly, in unmistakable terms and in an undeniable language. In the New Testament, the word RHEMA carries the idea of a quickened word.

        title: `It's Goal-Setting Time: Run to Win`,
        description: `
            "You’ve all been to the stadium and seen the athletes race. Everyone runs; one wins. Run to win. All good athletes train hard. They do it for a gold medal that tarnishes and fades. You’re after one that’s gold eternally" (1.Corinthians 9:24-25, MSG).
            It’s that time of year when we encourage all of our teams to start setting goals for the upcoming year. It’s an opportune moment to pause, reflect, and focus on the future. Just as athletes strive for the prize, we can also set meaningful goals that propel us toward a life of purpose and fulfillment.
            I. Dream Big – You Have a BIG GOD!
            Take a moment to imagine a life without limitations. If time and money were no obstacle, what dreams would you pursue? What habits would you leave behind? Allow yourself to dream boldly! Our God is greater than any challenge or barrier.
            II. Identify Your Core Values
            At the heart of effective goal setting lies a clear understanding of what matters most to you. List your core values — those principles you hold dear and are willing to live and die for. Brainstorm a list of as many values as you can think of using just one word for each. This process will ground you in what truly defines your life’s purpose.
            III. Craft Your Personal Mission Statement & Family Mission Statement
            Condense your values into a concise mission statement. Whether it’s for yourself or your family, articulate your mission in clear, present-tense terms. Let it reflect your commitment to God, to others, and to yourself. This will ensure that each aspect of your life aligns with your highest priorities.
            IV. List Your Roles
            Acknowledge the various roles you play in life — be it as a parent, spouse, friend, or professional. Embrace these roles fully and integrate them into your goal-setting process.  Recognising these roles will help you set balanced and comprehensive goals.
            V. Goal Setting – Be Spirit Led
            Your values and roles inform your goals. Define each goal with precision using actionable language. Utilise the SMART criteria: make your goals Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic (yet full of faith steps), and Time-bound. Break down each goal into manageable tasks to maintain focus and momentum.
            What movement do you want to see?
            To write a well-defined goal, write it as an ‘action statement’; start by using a ‘verb’.
            VI. Cultivate Balance
            Achieving balance across key areas of life is essential for emotional well-being.
                1. Nourish your spiritual life.
                2. Invest in meaningful relationships.
                3. Prioritize physical health.
                4. Cultivate mental agility (become a lifelong learner).
                5. Manage finances wisely.
                6. Pursue your calling with passion.
                7. Remember to have fun.
            VII. Accountability & Vision
            Hold yourself accountable by writing down your goals and making a firm commitment to achieving them. Share your goals with a trusted accountability partner who will support and encourage you along the way. Consider creating a vision board — a visual representation of your aspirations — to keep you motivated and focused.
            In conclusion, let’s approach the upcoming year with purpose and determination. By aligning our ambitions with our faith and values, we can run our race to win the prize that endures forever.
            I trust these 7 Steps will help you get ready for the next year with clarity, intentionality, and a steadfast commitment to personal growth. Dream big, set goals boldly, and trust God to guide you on this journey. Happy goal setting!

        title: `Are You Marching?`,
        description: `
            Hebrews chapter 11 is filled with the names of saints of old who marched by faith. Can you hear them? Tramp. Tramp. Tramp. There they go—receiving the blessings of God.
            By faith, these men and women subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, and escaped the edge of the sword.

            Can you hear that same sound today? It’s the sound of those who are marching by faith. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp. Listen, and you can hear them. It’s the sound of those who are possessing the promises of God. They are marching by faith to receive what God has said is theirs. They have the promises of God lined up in their sights, and they’re not letting go.

            They’re marching by faith in a God Who has said that all things are possible to those who believe. They’re marching by faith in a God Who has promised to supply whatever they need.

            Quit standing on the sidelines. Grab hold of the Word of God, jump out, and begin to march. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp. Dare to open your mouth and say what God said. Begin marching by faith for your victory.
            I won’t say it will be easy. Things will not always turn out the way you expected. The truth is, you will experience a few setbacks. Heaven’s hall of fame is filled with individuals who had setbacks. But they kept going even after failure and defeat; they persevered and believed God.

            Although you may get weary, you have to learn to keep on marching. Keep on going.

            Look closely at the people you are marching with—those named in the Word of God and those who are around you. You will find that you are surrounded by the imperfect, the undignified, the unwanted, the rejected, and the unrecognized. You’ll find the scarred and the wounded, the crippled, the battle weary, and the exhausted. But that’s not the entire story. These men and women have marched past their feelings. They have marched beyond the point of emotional sensitivity. They are obeying the commands of God and are marching their way to victory.

            I can hear them march. Tramp. Tramp. Tramp. There they go.

            You can hear them marching to receive the promise of God. You can hear them marching to obey the call of God on their lives. You can hear them marching as they persevere and overcome every obstacle that gets in front of them.

            I want to urge those who are wounded, battle scarred, crippled, and too exhausted to get back up: Stand up now and start marching.
            And say this as you go:
            “I’m marching by faith. I’m receiving all God has for me. I’m receiving everything the Bible says belongs to me. I’m obeying God and His call. I’m going to walk over the top of everything that gets in my way. I’m going to march to victory. There are not enough devils in hell to keep me from getting my victory. I’m not turning back. Nothing can stop me. By faith, here I go! Hallelujah!”

        title: `Releasing the Rivers of God's Spirit`,
        description: `
            In the Old Testament, another name for the ‘Temple of God’ was the ‘House of God’. Today, because of Jesus Christ and that we’ve chosen to receive and follow Him, WE are the ‘house’ God has chosen to live in.
            1 Peter 2:5 says you are “being built up as a spiritual house”. And it’s written in Hebrews 3:6 that, “Christ is faithful over God's house as a son. And we are His house, if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope” (ESV).
            Furthermore, Paul reveals in 1 Corinthians 3:16 and 6:19 how our bodies are now God’s temple and that the Spirit dwells in us. We are the ‘house of God’, the ‘Temple of God’. There can be a collective nature to this since we are all ‘in Christ’ — and together are ‘the Body of Christ’, but it’s also true individually. The Spirit now dwells in each of us.
            We find important parallels between the original Tabernacle (of Moses), the Temple (which Solomon built), and us as God’s Temple today. There were three main parts to both the Tabernacle and the Temple: the Outer Courts, the Holy Place, and the Most Holy Place. 
                • Our body could be compared to the Outer Court.
                • Our soul (mind, will, and emotions) can be compared to The Holy Place — and it is at least supposed to be kept holy.
                • Then our heart / spirit can be compared to the Most Holy Place where God’s Presence dwelt.
            God made it clear to Moses and Solomon that they were to build exactly as God would show them. Why? Because the very structure would be a prophetic example of what God wanted to build in you and me.
            God didn’t want to be limited to that Most Holy Place. He wanted to come out and flow in every direction. We see this image in the prophetic vision Ezekiel had, where water flows out of the Temple in every direction bringing life and healing; “everything will live where the river goes” (Ezekiel 47:9, ESV). Why? Because God loves ALL people EVERYWHERE.
            See yourself as a carrier of this river. Wherever it goes (and wherever you go) the river is bringing healing and life. What a fantastic reality this is for us today!
            You can understand then why the Lord spoke through the Prophet Haggai that, all nations “shall come to the Desire of All Nations, and I will fill this temple with glory… The glory of this latter temple shall be greater than the former… And in this place I will give peace” (Haggai 2:7 and 9, NKJV).
            Jesus proclaimed in John 7:38 that, “He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water”. So, because we believe in Him, from inside of you, from inside of me, flow RIVERS of living water.
            So as His Temple, filled with His Spirit, let’s begin to see ourselves bringing these mighty rivers of life and healing everywhere we go and to everyone we meet. We speak words of life. We lay hands on the sick, and they are healed. What a privilege and an honor it is to be carriers of this great life! So let the RIVERS flow!

        title: `On Following Jesus and Endless Alternatives`,
        description: `
            “As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.” At once they left their nets and followed Him. Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him” (Matthew 4:18-22, NIV).
            It is hard for us to grasp the significance of this scene, because we live in a very different culture than first-century Galilee, but we see that as these fishermen leave their work to follow Jesus, they also leave their father.
            Most likely, fishing was their family’s occupation for generations and maybe even centuries. These fishermen did not choose this profession, but in a sense they were living the life and doing the work that was chosen for them. Jesus understands this deeply as He asks them to give up the life they’ve always known, the future they expected, and even their sense of loyalty to their family.
            When Jesus calls, everything else becomes secondary; there is always a cost.
            The Sea of Galilee represented their job, their security, their sense of identity, and their family relationships—everything was either left behind or redefined in an instant when they followed Him. We see in Matthew that they immediately leave the sea to follow Him. In rabbinic speech, this meant becoming His students, joining His school, and living with Him.
            Today, Jesus is still calling disciples. But He is walking beside another sea. It's not the sea of the life that you were given by family and culture; it's a sea of endless alternative lives that we could possibly choose for ourselves.
            Psychologists speak of the paradox of choice, a phenomenon that explores the abundance of choices and possibilities we face—from the energy drinks we consume, to our college degrees and professions. There are sometimes so many choices that we end up not choosing at all. It's in this kind of world that His call resounds.
            What does it mean to follow Jesus in a world like ours where you can travel anywhere you want, get the most exotic food delivered to your doorstep, and "reinvent" yourself while subscribing to unending, numbing entertainment?
            What does discipleship look like in a culture that distracts us with the latest and shiniest, while offering us myriads of ‘comfortable’ alternatives?
            I believe one of the answers is to develop an eternal perspective.
            An eternal perspective starts with realizing how finite life in this age is. It's not just that it is short, but that it is limited. The endless sea of alternative lives is a smokescreen, because every choice is also a rejection of something. The decisions we make actually matter, as they either propel us forward into Jesus’ future for us or lead us into the paralyzing “freedom” of pursuing the ways and desires of the world.
            Moses prays: “So teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom” (Psalm 90:12, NKJV). To follow Jesus in this world means we need to become wise, mastering the art of decision-making and maximizing our time in light of the reality that we only have one life.
            An eternal perspective goes beyond recognizing the brevity of life. It's not just that life is short and finite, but that there is a Day coming where our lives will be evaluated. It's not just carpe diem (seize the day), but Maranatha (Our Lord comes). And it's against that Day that we measure our present days. All roads ultimately lead to the Judgement Seat of Christ.
            Jackie Pullinger, the British missionary to Hong Kong, expressed it starkly: “Eternal life is forever. We’re going to feel stupid for eternity if we wasted this one”.
            In light of this, we live with a single focus on Jesus, who embodied an eternal perspective. His face was set like flint towards the city of the great King where a cross awaited — the cross He endured with the joy set before Him.
            Leave the sea.
            Burn the ships.
            Live with Jesus.

        title: `Asking Boldly in This Hour`,
        description: `
            Have you ever judged how effective your prayer was based on how you felt during prayer or how you thought you were acting that day?
            Our confidence in prayer shouldn’t be in ourselves. When we pray, it’s important to remember that our confidence is in God Almighty. We see this in 1.John 5:14-15: “Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him”.
            Asking boldly...
            The word for confidence is also translated as bold or boldly. We are to be bold in prayer. We can approach God boldly, because we are in Christ; we’re clean because of His Blood. God has a high standard – the highest! But that’s already been achieved by Jesus, our Lord. We can be confident because our faith is in God (Mark 11:22). He is faithful to His Word, which is His will. When His Word (His will) is the springboard to our requests, we can and should be bold!
            In this hour...
            The return of our Lord is an old message, but right now there is a fresh urgency to it.
                • There are many things that must be accomplished in prayer to facilitate the plan of God. (1.Timothy 2:1-4)
                • Peter wrote: “But the end of all things is at hand; therefore, be serious and watchful in your prayers.” (1.Peter 4:7)
                • While Daniel was yet praying, the angel Gabriel was being sent! (Daniel 9:21)
            We must have confidence that God answers the petitions we bring to Him about His plans and purposes in this hour.
            With the Name of Jesus that we’ve been given, we can pray with the confidence that Jesus prayed. Jesus said, "Father, I thank You that You have heard Me” (John 11:41). We can be like Jesus and say, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me.” And our confidence is this: “if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we KNOW that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him!” (1.John 5:15).
            *All Scripture references are from the NKJV.

            This course covers the purpose and importance of prayer, different kinds of prayer that are found in the Bible, and being led by the Holy Spirit in prayer.

        title: `The Importance of Becoming a Team`,
        description: `
            ”Fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.
            Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit,
            but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself.”
            Philippians 2:2-3 (NKJV)
            Group vs. Team
            A ‘team’ differs from a ‘group of people doing things together’, though we have sometimes mistakenly referred to ‘a group’ as ‘a team’. Both a group and a team must have something that brings them together: for a group, maybe it is a common interest; for a team it is a common purpose and commitment. A group may be full of people with an individualistic mindset — they are there mainly for themselves and their own gain. A real team can't function that way. Like Paul addresses in Philippians 2:2-3, there is a wrong team mentality (selfish ambition, conceit), or a desired one (humility, unity).
            
            “Good teams become great ones when the members trust each other enough to surrender the Me for the We.” — Phil Jackson, Chicago Bulls
            
            A group can be put together quickly, but it takes time to turn them into a team. It can take even more time if we don’t understand the difference between a ‘group’ and a ‘team’ or if we are unsure of How to START a Team or How to BECOME one.
            
            The Lord Jesus Christ Himself built different teams. We see ‘The Twelve’ in Luke 9:1-2, and ‘The Seventy’ in Luke 10:1-2. He spent time with them, teaching and training them, and He gave them opportunities to grow and to do. Jesus’ teams participated in His Kingdom activities and helped Him build the Church — both before His crucifixion and after His resurrection. In Acts 6:1-7, we can see new teams forming to help care for the growing Church.
            
            When we understand that we ought to work in and from teams, the question we must ask ourselves is: do we have the 'team' mindset?
            
            “Individuals play the game, but teams win championships.” ― John Maxwell
            
            A group usually can make things happen; however, it often lacks enough diversity in perspective and capability to make it happen really well over a long period of time. Because of lack of commitment and rapid turnover, groups can easily change or fall apart. A group often misses out on the perseverance and sustainability we find in teams. If we want to go the true distance and keep on improving, we need teams.
            
            “The truth is that teamwork is at the heart of great achievement.” — John Maxwell
            
            Turning a ‘group’ into a ‘team’ is an intentional process with certain steps imparted by the team leader to the team. A team is not just some random people working on something; it’s much more purposeful and strategic. Good leaders assemble their team(s) with the needed skills, aptitudes and strengths to accomplish more over a longer time; that diversity increases sustainability. Paul also instructed Timothy to “entrust to faithful men” — it’s not just about being willing or eager to make it happen, there must be faithfulness and commitment. A team wants to move further, learn and grow together, and function in unity. A team sticks up for one another and the team leader.

        title: `Adding Strength`,
        description: `
            "And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches." Acts 15:41 (NKJV)
            In the Book of Acts, we read about how the Apostle Paul traveled around teaching, preaching, starting churches, and often returning to some places more than once. In Acts 14:22, 15:41, and 18:23, Paul is described as "strengthening" the churches and disciples. Different translations may use different words in these verses for the word "strengthening", but the meaning there is "to strengthen more" or "to render more firm". Paul spent time with them, he wrote letters to them when we was away, he encouraged them to understand their strong foundation through studying Scripture, and prayed for them to be continually strengthened with all might and power through the Holy Spirit. We see a major focus of Paul’s ministry, and indeed an objective of any spiritual leader (Ephesians 4) is “strengthening” and “building up” the believers. 
            If you have ever done any kind of exercise or physical training, you know that it is something that takes place over a longer period of time and not just on one day. If you are doing a certain exercise, you don't just do it once and see instant results, you keep on doing the exercise to develop the muscles and gain strength. If you are interested in becoming a better swimmer, for example, you don't just spend one day in the pool, you repeatedly train and develop the technique and muscles that are necessary to be a better swimmer.
            So we see that training is a part of the strengthening process. RBTC is a Training Center/College because we recognize that growth is a process we must commit ourselves to. We are born again, but then we are sanctified and we mature. We are all called by God, but we are also equipped and trained.
            This “strengthening” principle can help us today in our own spiritual and personal growth as well as in ministry to others. We all need a regular time of reading and studying the Bible, time in prayer, and spending time with other like-minded believers. As we continue to do these things, we will develop and add strength to ourselves, and we will be a greater asset to God and to our local church.

        title: `A Life of Praise`,
        description: `
            The world is full of praise! You and I are praisers. We praise the things we value and the things that impress us. It might be the latest car model, Grandma’s muffins, the athlete who scored the game winning goal, or even Friday night’s pizza! We say, “Ooooh that was GREAT! Isn’t he AWESOME! I LOVE that pizza!” Now, it’s ok for us to enjoy and appreciate things in this life, but it is the praise of God that should fill our mouths.
            “I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
            My soul makes its boast in the LORD; let the humble hear and be glad.
            Oh magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together!”
            Psalm 34:1-3
            Using Psalm 34:1-3 as a guide, let’s look at some instructions God has given to help us be the praisers He desires us to be.
            “I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.”
            The words “all the time” and “continually” seem to imply… all the time!
            Hebrews 13:15 instructs us to “continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name”. It seems that God is saying to us that once a week or even once a day is not sufficient. Psalm 113:3 emphasizes this truth; “From the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the LORD is to be praised”. That would be all day long from sunrise to sunset! If we purpose to be doers of the Word, then we should start filling our mouths with His praise first thing in the morning.
            Many of us are looking for an energy boost in the morning. Maybe it’s a cup of coffee or a brisk walk outdoors. But the best morning energizer happens when we charge up our spiritual battery by plugging into God through praise. In the book, The Untapped Power of Praise, Kenneth W. Hagin writes, “The power of God is activated through praise because praise is the language of faith”. Now that’s a great way to start the day, expressing our faith through praise and activating God’s power in our lives!
            “My soul makes its boast in the LORD; let the humble hear and be glad.”
            Boasting? Aren’t we suppose to refrain from boasting? Not when you’re boasting about God! In fact, you can’t brag on Him enough!
            The most common Hebrew word translated praise in the Bible is halal — reminds you of Hallelujah, right? Halal means to boast, to rave about, to be noisy in your celebration of Him. If we do Halal, other people are going to hear something! It’s scriptural to brag on God and testify to others about what God has done for you. When the humble (those who are not relying on themselves, but acknowledging God as their help) hear your praise, they will be encouraged in God! For we build up ourselves and others in faith when we boast about God. Oh how it must please the Father to hear His children bragging on Him!
            “Oh magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together!”
            Magnify simply means to make large.
            When we look into a clear night sky, we will see tiny twinkling lights that are actually enormous stars and planets. A telescope can be used to magnify a distant object so we can see it more clearly. Praise is similar to the telescope, because praise magnifies God. Praise enlarges our vision of God and helps us see Him more clearly. When you declare that God is Great, your vision of Him gets bigger. When you praise Him for His faithfulness, you become more aware of His faithfulness to you.
            Remembering what God has done for you magnifies Him. In the Old Testament, God repeatedly reprimanded His people for failing to remember what He had done for them. Their forgetfulness caused God to become small in their eyes. When we remember and praise God for who He is and what He has done for us, He becomes bigger in our eyes and our faith is built up.
            So let’s fill our mouths with the praise of God! Let’s boast about Him! Let’s magnify His Name from sunrise to sunset for He alone is worthy of our praise!

        title: `Praying for God’s Will in Your Life`,
        description: `
            One way that we can find and follow God’s will for our life is through His Word. I am so glad that the Apostle Paul wrote down prayers that he prayed for the believers in Ephesus, Colossae, Philippi, etc. These prayers serve as examples of how we can pray for ourselves, so that we find and follow the will of God.
            Let’s just look at one of these prayers: Colossians 1:9-10 (NKJV)
            9 For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; 
            10 that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.
            This prayer is simple but powerful. You are to ask to be FILLED with the KNOWLEDGE of… what? HIS WILL. But it doesn’t stop there; it continues asking that you would know His will with ALL WISDOM and SPIRITUAL UNDERSTANDING. It is one thing to know God’s will regarding a situation, but when you have wisdom about it and then spiritual understanding, it makes you aware of all you need to do regarding His will.
            Verse 10 tells you why you need to do this: so that you would walk worthy of the Lord and be fruitful. According to John 15:16, you were ordained to bear fruit. It is why you are a branch connected to the Vine. Well, in order to bear fruit, you are going to have to be filled with His will and have wisdom and spiritual understanding regarding His will.
            I encourage you to prayer this prayer for yourself. Not just this prayer but other prayers you find in the Epistles. God wants you to be a fruit-bearing Christian — and to do that, you want to walk in His will.
            Another way to pray regarding God’s will for your life is to pray in other tongues.
            I Corinthians 14:2 says that when you speak in other tongues you speak mysteries. Jude 20 tells us you build yourself up. That word build, means to build the whole house.
            Whey you pray in other tongues, you pray about all the things God is interested in regarding your life. He knows the future and He can have you pray about things 5 years down the road that you have no clue about. It may be a mystery to you right now, but not to God. 
            You also build yourself (your whole house) up. Every part of your life that needs adjusting, God can have you pray about that when you pray in other tongues. He can help you build out every room of your life so that you walk in His will and ways.
            If you listen to our RHEMA founder, Brother Hagin, he credits praying in other tongues and praying the Epistle prayers as a significant part of why he was able to finish his race!
            Don’t neglect either of these ways to pray and you will find and follow God’s plan and purposes for your life.

        title: `The Anointing is Not Your Short Cut`,
        description: `
            As we look through the Bible, we can see that certain people were anointed by God to do certain things. Now with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, it’s even more important for each of us to understand how the anointing works in and through us and others. Let’s look at a couple examples we follow.
            Jesus was anointed. Acts 10:38 says, “how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him”. He declared: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me…” (Luke 4:18-19). Yet even He said, “I can of Myself do nothing”, and “…the Father who dwells in Me does the works” (John 5:30; 14:10). Paul also understood the anointing and said that he conducted his work in ministry by, “…striving with all the superhuman energy which He so mightily enkindles and works within me” (Colossians 1:29, AMP).
            Our prayer is that you may have greater understanding and discernment about the anointing, so you may cooperate more fully with the Holy Spirit. One way to understand what something is, is to look at what it is not.
            Here are 8 points explaining what the anointing is not:
                • A substitute for preparation
                • A short-cut to success
                • A stamp of approval
                • Exclusively synonymous with a specific style
                • A source of superiority
                • Synonymous with a strong personality
                • To be measured by the external response of people
                • Something that belongs exclusively to the five-fold ministry
            Let’s look closer at the first two points:
            1. The Anointing Is Not: A Substitute for Preparation
            Some preachers have relied upon Psalm 81:10 when it comes to ministry: “I am the LORD your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt; Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it”. In doing so, they have neglected 2 Timothy 2:15, where Paul told his young protégé: “Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth”.Spontaneity can certainly have its place, but so does study.
            Ministers must not only prepare messages; they must prepare themselves to minister the Word of God. I believe that the anointing (the presence and working of God’s Spirit) can be just as much a part of the preparation process as He is a part of the delivery process.
            One minister noted that information and inspiration do not need to be in competition with each other. Donald S. Whitney said, “Why do we seem to think we must choose between the two? Why do so many Christians live as though they’ve been told, ‘choose you this day whom you will serve: scholarship or devotion’? I maintain that a biblically-balanced Christian has both a full head and a full heart, radiating both spiritual light and heat”.
            To be negligent in preparation, while expecting the anointing to bail you out at the last minute, is presumptuous. It will be evidenced by shallow preaching and results that are less than optimal. On the other hand, we shouldn’t be so confident in what we have prepared that we are not trusting in the Holy Spirit or yielding to His influence when we do minister.
            2. The Anointing Is Not: A Short-Cut to Success
            Especially when starting out in ministry some think: “If I could just get this great anointing, then I’d have it made. The anointing would propel me into great success”. However, without other parts of their life and ministry being developed and matured properly, too much success could be ultimately detrimental. Countless ministers have experienced a sudden burst of (seeming) success due to a unique or strong anointing, only to have their ministry shipwrecked because of a lack of development in other areas.
            Someone wisely said, “Your charisma can take you where your character can’t keep you”.
            There are no short-cuts (or substitutes) in ministry. Having an “anointing” doesn’t take the place of endurance, character development, growth in the fruit of the Spirit, honesty, humility, and possessing a servant’s heart. It would seem that some ministers have had the idea that because they have a certain type of “anointing” that they are somehow exempt from such biblical mandates as walking in kindness, holiness, integrity, etc.
            So, the anointing does not replace general instructions given to all Believers. Let us not neglect or devalue the role of preparation and continued personal development in our life and in our ministry..

        title: `Knowing the Love of God`,
        description: `
            We read in Ephesians chapter 3 how the Apostle Paul prayed for the church at Ephesus: “that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height— to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God” (Ephesians 3:17-19, NKJV).
            The Amplified Classic version states verse 19 like this: “[That you may really come] to know [practically, through experience for yourselves] the love of Christ, which far surpasses mere knowledge [without experience]”.
            Paul prayed that they would come to know the love of Christ, yet the people he prayed for were believers. Did they not know the love of Christ? We learn from this passage that it’s possible to have only a “head knowledge” of God’s love, and that is quite different than knowing His love towards us through experience.
            Several months ago, I had the opportunity to take care of our 2-year-old grandson, Brady. At birth, Brady’s pancreas produced too much insulin that caused his blood sugars to be chronically low. At one month old, a large portion of his pancreas was removed to stabilize his body. Since the surgery, Brady is thriving and is a living testimony of God’s healing power working in his body. As Brady is walking out his healing, his blood sugar levels are monitored continuously. If his blood sugar gets low, an alarm will sound on his glucose monitor.
            One night, I put Brady to bed and went to sleep myself. A little while later, his blood sugar dropped. I slept through the first alarm and awoke to the second alarm. He was very low now. Frantically, I ran to the kitchen for a teaspoon of honey (a quick way to deliver sugars to his body). When I returned to his bedside, he was sitting up with the most peaceful look on his face, and his eyes seemed to go right through me. It was as if Brady silently said, “Lolli, you don’t have to be afraid”. You could see his spirit was at rest with a childlike trust in the One who made him. At that moment I heard the Lord say, “Linda, I care for Brady affectionately and watchfully, just as I do you”. It was a moment where God’s love penetrated so profoundly that I was emotionally overwhelmed. All feelings of disappointment in myself for missing his alarm faded away.
            This is not the first time I have experienced this revelation love from God, but it is a recent reminder of how overwhelming His love for us is. God wants us to have more than just an intellectual understanding of His love. When you come to know through experience the love He has for you, it will change your life. You will live without fear when you know how much God cares about you. Certainly, with Brady, we do everything we know to do concerning his blood sugars; this is a duty we take very seriously when his parents entrust him in our care. However, because of God’s great love for Brady, we know that as we steward him, God more than makes up the difference when situations arise. Psalm 121:3 tells us that, “He who keeps you will not slumber” (NKJV). The God of the Universe holds Brady in his sleep and stirred me awake to take care of his needs.
            Knowing the love of Christ that passes mere “head knowledge” will create rest in you. God wants you to be secure in His love.
            

            If we understood God’s love, then perhaps we wouldn’t question so many things — like whether God will meet our needs, or where the answer to our prayer is. People who “struggle” to receive answers to their prayers may say, "I just need more faith!” Yes, it’s good to strengthen your faith, but the foundation for faith is knowing how much God loves you. How could we believe God for anything if we aren’t secure in His love for us? Would we even have the confidence to ask? Trusting God will not be difficult when you have experienced God’s love.

            
            As you spend time meditating on His love, you'll see in tangible ways how His love has poured out to you every single day. God loves you!
