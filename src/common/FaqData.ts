            RHEMA students comprise a wide variety of backgrounds: doctors, lawyers, denominational
            ministers, pastors, politicians, youth corpers, farmers, artisans, bankers, secretaries, housewives,
            and educators are among the more than 116,000 worldwide RHEMA alumni. Each person has a
            particular benefit to offer the Body of Christ because of the uniqueness of his own personality and
            the gifts present in his life.

            There is no minimal age, however a Pastor must recommend the potential student. The potential
            student must also be able to handle the academic requirements.`

            We have a very large and varied instructor pool that includes instructors from around the world
            each have proven ministry or other leadership experience. Every Instructor must be pre-approved
            by our President, Kenneth W. Hagin and/or the RBTC USA Leadership Team. Our commitment is
            to expose you to the highest quality instruction ensuring that you receive as good, or even better
            instruction than if you were attending class in the USA.

        desription: `
            Every RBTC around the world, including RBTC Beirut must teach at least 90% of what is taught in
            Tulsa, OK, USA. RBTC Beirut curriculum exceeds this standard. In some cases, RHEMA Lebanon
            exceeds the USA and also contextualizes it for the Lebanon curriculum.

        title: `WILL THE COURSES OFFERED BE OF ANY REAL BENEFIT TO SOMEONE WHO HAS
                ALREADY BEEN IN THE MINISTRY?`,
        desription: `
            Yes. Actually, it’s those who have been in ministry who tend to benefit the most as they value the
            practical classes more than someone who has not yet experienced real-life ministry. Many of our
            courses cover materials that many ministers say, “we wish we would have been taught at Bible
            College”. The insight received will enable anyone who has been in ministry, no matter how long, to
            be more effective.

        desription: `
            Yes. RBTC is designed to be very accessible, allowing you to continue work, family responsibilities
            and church leadership roles, as well as fulfill your study requirements. It will take effort and at times
            you will need to make temporary adjustments to your schedule, but the school options are created
            for people with busy lives and we have received a lot of positive feedback regarding how even
            VERY busy people (bankers, doctors, senior pastors etc.) have been able to attend RBTC.

            No. If students are relocating from outside the city, they will be responsible for their own
            employment and living arrangements. If you are relocating to the area, please contact the local
            campus to see how they can help point you in the direction as to where you can find information to

            Smart ‘business casual’ – you do not need to wear a suit and tie, but you are welcome to. We only
            ask that you dress in a manner that is proper for someone being trained for leadership. More on
            this is found in the student handbook.

            There are no minimum educational requirements. However, you should be able to read and write
            English/Arabic to a basic level. RBTC Beirut is not overly academic, but there is a lot of reading. We
            have had some who have required aid in reading due to physical limitations, or learning challenges
            and with the aid of a partner they have been able to be very successful in completing the course.

            If you are unable to attend both levels consecutively, you may return at a later time and complete
            the advanced program. A certificate of completion is awarded after completing the 1st level (Basic
            Training), but graduation diplomas are only awarded only after completion of both 1st & 2nd levels.

            No. Regardless of your experience or training, everyone is required to complete the Level 1 – Basic
            Training program in full before enrolling in the Level 2 – Advanced Training program. Our training is
            so specialized, and Advanced Training builds on the Basic Training curriculum, so that even having
            attended a very good training program previously, there will be too many aspects of the program
            that a student would miss out on for them to get the most benefit from Level 2 (Advanced Training).

            When a person graduates from RBTC Beirut they carry the same status as any RBTC Graduates
            from any of the nearly 300 campuses around the world. In fact, if a person completes Level 1 at
            RBTC Beirut, they could possibly transfer to any of the other worldwide campuses to do Level 2.

            We strive to minister to the heart of the student, not educate the head at the expense of the heart.
            Therefore, though there are some courses that will be challenging to some students, the goal is not
            to get students to remember a lot of data including dates, names and specific facts, but instead to
            train them to be highly skilled ministers, who know how to depend and rely on the leading and
